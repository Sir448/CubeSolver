# CubeSolver
Solves a rubiks cube based on a scramble algorithm using a brute force method.

QTM = Quarter Turn Metric - 90 degree (quarter) turns count as one move
HTM = Half Turn Metric - 90 (quarter) or 180 (half) degree turns count as one move
STM = Slice Turn Metric - Also allows slice turns which means turning the center row/column. Equivalent to two quarter or half turns.

Scrambler generates scramble algorithm to input into solvers.
